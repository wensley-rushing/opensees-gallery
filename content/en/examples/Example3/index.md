![Example 3.1](img/Example2.svg)

This set of examples investigates the nonlinear analysis of a reinforced
concrete frame. The nonlinear beam column element with a fiber
discretization of the cross section is used in the model.
The investigation is adapted from the work of McKenna and Scott (2001).

## Model Building

The function `create_portal` creates a model representing the portal
frame in the figure above.
The model consists of four nodes, two
nonlinear beam-column elements modeling the columns and an
elastic beam element to model the girder. 
For the column elements a section, identical to the section used in Example 2, 
is created using steel and concrete fibers.

1. Begin with nodes and boundary conditions

## Gravity Analysis

We now implement a function called `gravity_analysis`
which takes the instance of `Model` returned by `create_portal`,
and proceeds to impose gravity loads and perform a static analysis.
Its use will look like:

{{< tabs tabTotal="2" >}}
{{% tab name="Python" %}}
```python
# Create the model
model = create_portal()

# perform analysis under gravity loads
status = gravity_analysis(model)
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Tcl" %}}
```tcl
create_portal;
gravity_analysis;
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

Inside the function, a single load pattern with a `Linear` time series is created and two vertical nodal loads  are added acting at nodes `3` and `4`:

{{< tabs tabTotal="2" >}}
{{% tab name="Python" %}}
```python
...
model.pattern("Plain", 1, "Linear", load={
# nodeID  xForce yForce zMoment
     3:   [ 0.0,   -P,   0.0],
     4:   [ 0.0,   -P,   0.0]
})
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Tcl" %}}
```tcl
# Create a Plain load pattern with a Linear TimeSeries
pattern Plain 1 "Linear" {
      # Create nodal loads at nodes 3 & 4
      #    nd    FX          FY  MZ 
      load  3   0.0  [expr -$P] 0.0
      load  4   0.0  [expr -$P] 0.0
}
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}


The model contains material non-linearities, so a solution algorithm of type `Newton` is used. 
{{< tabs tabTotal="2" >}}
{{% tab name="Python (RT)" %}}
```python
model.algorithm("Newton")
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Tcl" %}}
```tcl
algorithm Newton;
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

<!--
The solution algorithm uses a `ConvergenceTest` which
tests convergence of the equilibrium solution with the norm of the
displacement increment vector. 
-->

For this nonlinear problem, the gravity loads are applied incrementally until the full load is applied. 
To achieve this, a `LoadControl` integrator is used which advances the solution with
an increment of `0.1` at each load step. 
{{< tabs tabTotal="2" >}}
{{% tab name="Python (RT)" %}}
```python
model.integrator("LoadControl", 0.1)
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Tcl" %}}
```tcl
integrator LoadControl 0.1;
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

<!--
Once all the components of an analysis are defined, the Analysis object
itself is created. For this problem a Static analysis is defined. 
{{< tabs tabTotal="2" >}}
{{% tab name="Tcl" %}}
```tcl
analysis Static
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Python (RT)" %}}
```python
model.analysis("Static")
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}
-->

To achieve the full gravity load, 10 load steps are performed.
{{< tabs tabTotal="2" >}}
{{% tab name="Python (RT)" %}}
```python
model.analyze(10)
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Tcl" %}}
```tcl
analyze 10
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

At end of analysis, the state at nodes 3 and 4 is printed. The state of
element 1 is also reported.

<!--
For the two nodes, displacements and loads are given. For the
beam-column elements, the element end forces in the local system are
provided.

The `nodeGravity.out` file contains ten lines, each line containing 7
entries. The first entry is time in the domain at end of the load step.
The next 3 entries are the displacements at node 3, and the final 3
entries the displacements at node 4.
-->

## Pushover analysis

After performing the gravity load analysis on the model, the time in the
domain is reset to `0.0` and the current value of all loads acting are held constant. 
A new load pattern with a linear time series and horizontal loads acting at nodes `3` and `4` is then added to the model.

For the Pushover analysis we will use a [`DisplacementControl`](https://xara.so/user/manual/analysis/integrator/DisplacementControl.html) strategy. 
In displacement control we specify a incremental displacement `dU` 
that we would like to see at a nodal DOF and the strategy iterates to
determine what the pseudo-time (load factor if using a linear time
series) is required to impose that incremental displacement. 
For this example, at each new step in the analysis the integrator will determine
the load increment necessary to increment the horizontal displacement at
node 3 by 0.1 in. 

```python
dU = 0.1
model.integrator("DisplacementControl", 3, 1, dU, 1, dU, dU)
```

At each new analysis step the integrator will determine the load increment necessary to increment the horizontal displacement at node `3` by `0.1` inches. 
As the example is nonlinear and nonlinear models do not always
converge the analysis is carried out inside a while loop. The loop will
either result in the model reaching it's target displacement or it will
fail to do so. At each step a single analysis step is performed. If the
analysis step fails using standard Newton solution algorithm, another
strategy using initial stiffness iterations will be attempted.

{{< tabs tabTotal="2" >}}
{{% tab name="Python" %}}
```python
u, p = [], []
while status == ops.successful and u[-1] < maxU:

    status = model.analyze(1)

    # if the analysis failed, try initial tangent iteration
    if status != ops.successful:
        print("... Newton failed, trying initial stiffness")
        model.test("NormDispIncr", 1.0e-12, 1000, 5)
        model.algorithm("ModifiedNewton", initial=True)
        status = model.analyze(1)
        if status == ops.successful:
            print("... that worked, back to regular Newton")

        model.test("NormDispIncr", 1.0e-12, 10)
        model.algorithm("Newton")

    u.append(model.nodeDisp(3, 1))
    p.append(model.getTime())

if status != ops.successful:
    raise Exception("Pushover analysis failed")
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Tcl" %}}
```tcl
# set some parameters
set maxU 15.0; # Max displacement set ok 0 set currentDisp 0.0

# perform the analysis
while {$ok == 0 && [getTime] < $maxU} {
    set ok [analyze 1]

    # if the analysis fails try initial tangent iteration
    if {$ok != 0} { 
        puts "regular newton failed .. lets try an initial stiffness for this step" 
        test NormDispIncr 1.0e-12 1000 
        algorithm ModifiedNewton -initial 
        set ok [analyze 1] 
        if {$ok == 0} {
            puts "that worked .. back to regular newton"
        }
        test NormDispIncr 1.0e-12 10 algorithm Newton 
    }
}
set currentDisp [nodeDip 3 1]
}

# print out a SUCCESS or FAILURE MESSAGE
if {$ok == 0} { 
    puts "Pushover analysis completed SUCCESSFULLY"; }
else {
    puts "Pushover analysis FAILED"; 
}
```

For this analysis the nodal displacements at node `3` will be
stored in the variable `u` for post-processing. 
<!--
In addition,
the end forces in the local coordinate system for elements 1 and 2 will
be stored in the file `elePushover.out`. 
-->

At the end of the analysis, the
state of node 3 is printed to the screen.

<!--
In addition to what is displayed on the screen, the file `node32.out` and
`ele32.out` have been created by the script. Each line of `node32.out`
contains the time, DX, DY and RZ for node 3 and DX, DY and RZ for node 4
at the end of an iteration. Each line of `eleForce.out` contains the time,
and the element end forces in the local coordinate system. 
-->

A plot of the load-displacement relationship at node 3 is shown in
the figure below.

## Dynamic Analysis

<!-- 3.3 -->

The concrete frame which has undergone
the gravity load analysis is now subjected to an earthquake load.

After performing the gravity load analysis, the time in the domain is
reset to `0.0` and the time series for all active loads is set to constant. 
This prevents the gravity load from being scaled with each
step of the dynamic analysis.

{{< tabs tabTotal="2" >}}
{{% tab name="Python" %}}
```python
model.loadConst(time=0.0)
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Tcl" %}}
```tcl
loadConst -time 0.0
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

Mass terms are added to nodes 3 and 4. A new uniform
excitation load pattern is created. 

The `rayleigh` method is used to add stiffness proportional damping to the system. 
The damping term will be based on the last committed stifness of the
elements, i.e. \(C = a_c K_{\text{commit}}\) with \(a_c = 0.000625\). 
{{< tabs tabTotal="2" >}}
{{% tab name="Python" %}}
```python
model.rayleigh(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.000625)
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Tcl" %}}
```tcl
rayleigh 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.000625
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}


The excitation acts in the
horizontal direction and reads the acceleration record and time interval
from the file `ARL360.g3`. The file `ARL360.g3` is created from the 
[PEER Strong Motion Database](https://ngawest2.berkeley.edu/) record
`ARL360.at2` using the Tcl procedure `ReadSMDFile` contained in the file
`ReadSMDFile.tcl`.

The static analysis and its components are first deleted so that a new transient analysis procedure can be defined.

<!--
A new solution Algorithm of type `Newton` is then created. 
The solution algorithm uses a `ConvergenceTest` which tests convergence on the norm of
the displacement increment vector. 
-->
The integrator for this analysis will use the *Newmark* method with \(\gamma = 0.25\) and \(\beta = 0.5\). 

{{< tabs tabTotal="2" >}}
{{% tab name="Python" %}}
```python
model.integrator("Newmark",  0.5,  0.25)
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Tcl" %}}
```tcl
integrator Newmark  0.5  0.25 
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}


<!--
The equations are formed using a banded storage scheme, so the System is
BandGeneral. The equations are numbered using an RCM (reverse Cuthill-McKee)
numberer. The constraints are enforced with a Plain constraint handler.
-->

Once all the components of an analysis are defined, the Analysis object
itself is created. For this problem a Transient analysis is used.
`2000` time steps are performed with a time step of `0.01`.

In addition to the transient analysis, two eigenvalue evaluations are
performed. 
The first is performed after the gravity analysis and the second after the transient analysis.

For this analysis the nodal displacenments at Nodes 3 and 4 will be
stored in the file `nodeTransient.out` for post-processing. In addition
the section forces and deformations for the section at the base of
column 1 will also be stored in two seperate files. 
The results of the eigenvalue analysis will be displayed on the screen.

<!--
In addition to the contents displayed on the screen, three files have
been created. 
Each line of `nodeTransient.out` contains the domain time,
and DX, DY and RZ for node 3. Plotting the first and second columns of
this file the lateral displacement versus time for node 3 can be

| `gravity_analysis`   | Performs a gravity analysis on a model
| `pushover_analysis`  | Performs a pushover analysis on a model
| `transient_analysis` | Performs a transient analysis on a model


A complete analysis may look as follows:

```python
def main():
    # Create the model
    model = create_portal()

    # Perform analysis under gravity loads
    gravity_analysis(model)

    # Perform transient analysis
    pushover_analysis(model)

    # Print the state at node 3
    model.print("node", 3)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
